# PORTLAND COFFEE BREWRU

This maps application uses the Google Maps API to display local coffee shops in Portland, Oregon.
The Numbers API (numbersapi.com) was used as well to generate facts about a random number to be viewed in an
infowindow when a marker is clicked. These facts are meant to be read as you enjoy your cup of coffee.

Instructions
1. Open index.html in a code editor.
2. At the bottom of the page, replace "API_KEY" with your Google's API key in the Google url.

display markers of coffee shops within an area, destination input that will display a route from the coffee
shop based on time and form of transportation, and lastly an input to search for places near the coffee shops.
