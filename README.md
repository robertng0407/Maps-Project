The Foursquare API (numbersapi.com) is used as well to generate more information about the location inside
the infowindow when a marker is clicked.

menu will display a list of local coffee shops in the Portland area. The field in this menu will allow you
to filter through the list. The second menu will allow you to display all coffee shops, hide coffee shops,
display markers of coffee shops within an area, destination input that will display a route from the coffee
shop based on time and form of transportation, and lastly an input to search for places near the coffee shops.
